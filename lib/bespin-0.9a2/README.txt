Bespin Embedded
===============

Quick Start
-----------

The "prebuilt" directory contains all of the files you need to get Bespin
up and running right away.

Take a look at the Bespin Embedders Guide (in the docs directory) for 
more information.

Customizing Bespin
------------------

This package also allows you to change which features
are built into your Bespin Embedded script, even including your own custom
features.

You'll need either Python 2.5 with simplejson or Python 2.6 to build your own
custom Bespin.

For more information, look in the Bespin Embedders Guide in the docs directory.
